## Features

### Core Features
- **Real-time Fraud Detection API**:
  - Input: Single transaction in JSON format.
  - Output: Fraud prediction (`is_fraud`), fraud source (`rule`/`model`), fraud reason, and fraud score.
  - Latency: < 300ms.
- **Batch Fraud Detection API**:
  - Input: Multiple transactions in JSON format.
  - Output: Fraud predictions for each transaction.
  - Parallel processing for efficient handling of large datasets.
- **Fraud Reporting API**:
  - Input: Fraud report details (transaction ID, reporting entity, fraud details).
  - Output: Acknowledgment of the report.
- **Transaction and Fraud Monitoring Dashboard**:
  - View raw transaction data with fraud predictions and reports.
  - Filter and search functionality.
  - Dynamic graphs for comparing predicted vs. reported frauds.
  - Time series analysis and evaluation metrics (confusion matrix, precision, recall).

## Enhanced AI Capabilities

### 1. **Explainable AI (XAI)**
- **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**:
  - Provides insights into why a transaction was flagged as fraudulent.
  - Increases transparency and trust in the system.

### 2. **Anomaly Detection**
- **Isolation Forest**:
  - Detects unusual patterns that traditional models might miss.
  - Enhances the system's ability to identify new and evolving fraud tactics.

### 3. **Continuous Learning**
- **Online Learning**:
  - The AI model updates itself in real-time as new fraud patterns emerge.
  - Ensures the system stays ahead of fraudsters.

### 4. **Ensemble Models**
- **Combination of Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks**:
  - Improves prediction accuracy by leveraging the strengths of multiple models.

## Advanced Dashboard Features

### 1. **Real-Time Alerts**
- **Push Notifications and Emails**:
  - Sends real-time alerts for high-risk transactions.

### 2. **Fraud Heatmaps**
- **Geographic Heatmaps**:
  - Visualizes fraud hotspots by region, payment channel, or time of day.

### 3. **User Behavior Analytics**
- **Behavioral Anomalies**:
  - Detects unusual user activity (e.g., sudden spikes in transaction amounts or frequency).

### 4. **Interactive Visualizations**
- **Drill-Down Capabilities**:
  - Allows users to explore data in detail.
- **Zoomable Time Series**:
  - Dynamically adjusts the granularity of time on the x-axis based on the selected time frame and zoom level.

### 5. **Predictive Analytics**
- **Fraud Trend Forecasting**:
  - Uses time series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to predict future fraud trends.
- **Risk Scoring**:
  - Assigns risk scores to users based on their transaction history and behavior.
