## ✨ Features

### 🔥 Core Features
- **⚡ Fraud Detection API (Real-time)**:
  - 📥 Input: Single transaction in JSON format.
  - 📤 Output: Fraud prediction (`is_fraud`), fraud source (`rule`/`model`), fraud reason.
  - 💾 Must store data in a database.
  - ⚡ Latency: < 300ms.
- **📊 Fraud Detection API (Batch)**:
  - 📥 Input: Multiple transactions in JSON format.
  - 📤 Output: Fraud predictions for each transaction.
  - 🚀 Should process transactions in parallel.
- **📝 Fraud Reporting API**:
  - 📥 Input: Fraud report details (transaction ID, reporting entity, fraud details).
  - 📤 Output: Acknowledgment of the report.
  - 💾 Must store data in a database.
- **📡 Transaction & Fraud Monitoring Dashboard**:
  - 🔍 Show raw transaction data with fraud predictions and reports.
  - 🎯 Filter and search functionality.
  - 📈 Dynamic graphs for comparing predicted vs. reported frauds.
  - 📊 Time series analysis and evaluation metrics (confusion matrix, precision, recall).

## 🤖 Enhanced AI Capabilities

### 1. **💡 Explainable AI (XAI)**
- **🔍 SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**:
  - Provides insights into why a transaction was flagged as fraudulent.
  - Increases transparency and trust in the system.

### 2. **🚨 Anomaly Detection**
- **🌲 Isolation Forest**:
  - Detects unusual patterns that traditional models might miss.
  - Enhances the system's ability to identify new and evolving fraud tactics.

### 3. **📚 Continuous Learning**
- **🧠 Online Learning**:
  - The AI model updates itself in real-time as new fraud patterns emerge.
  - Ensures the system stays ahead of fraudsters.

### 4. **🤖 Ensemble Models**
- **⚡ Combination of Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks**:
  - Improves prediction accuracy by leveraging the strengths of multiple models.

## 📊 Advanced Dashboard Features

### 1. **🔔 Real-Time Alerts**
- **📨 Push Notifications & Emails**:
  - Sends real-time alerts for high-risk transactions.

### 2. **🗺️ Fraud Heatmaps**
- **🌎 Geographic Heatmaps**:
  - Visualizes fraud hotspots by region, payment channel, or time of day.

### 3. **📈 User Behavior Analytics**
- **🕵️ Behavioral Anomalies**:
  - Detects unusual user activity (e.g., sudden spikes in transaction amounts or frequency).

### 4. **📊 Interactive Visualizations**
- **🔍 Drill-Down Capabilities**:
  - Allows users to explore data in detail.
- **🔎 Zoomable Time Series**:
  - Dynamically adjusts the granularity of time on the x-axis based on the selected time frame and zoom level.

### 5. **📉 Predictive Analytics**
- **🔮 Fraud Trend Forecasting**:
  - Uses time series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to predict future fraud trends.
- **📊 Risk Scoring**:
  - Assigns risk scores to users based on their transaction history and behavior.
